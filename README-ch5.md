# Instructions for chapter 5

Montfort's Chapter 5, "Double, Double," asks you to study a function, make some predictions about how it works, and then change it: to explore the code as we did with the poetry generators last week.

## 1. Open a new Jupyter Notebook in your repo

If you're already running a notebook for chapter 4, all you need to do is use the File menu to select New Notebook > Python 3 (ipykernel).

Otherwise, see the [instructions accompanying chapter 4](README-ch4.md#1-open-a-new-jupyter-notebook-in-your-repo).


## 2. Read and do

<div class="alert alert-success">
Follow along with <a class="alert-link" href="https://mitpress.ublish.com/ebook/epah2e-preview/12629/53">the chapter</a>. Each time you come to a bit of code in the book, enter it in your own Jupyter Notebook and press Shift-Enter to run it.</div>


## 3. Save and commit

As you work, periodically stop to save your progress using File > Save As or the disc icon.

And as you finish each iteration of Free Project 5-1 (or whenever you want), also commit your changes, writing a meaningful commit message to describe what you've done.

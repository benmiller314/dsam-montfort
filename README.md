# Playing with programming

In this repository, we're going to continue practicing with GitHub â€“ and now also try out the exercises in [_Exploratory Programming for the Arts and Humanities_ (2nd edition)](https://mitpress.ublish.com/ebook/epah2e-preview/12629/31) by Nick Montfort. The goal is to learn some programming fundamentals by messing around with some existing scripts.

You do not need any prior programming experience! You do, however, need a plain-text editor like [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
